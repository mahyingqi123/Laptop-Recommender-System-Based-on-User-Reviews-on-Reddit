# Laptop Recommender System Based on User Reviews on Reddit

Laptop Recommender System Based on User Reviews on Reddit is the **Final Year Project** of Team MCS5 from Monash University.

## Overview

This project provides a full-stack laptop recommendation system powered by **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. By scraping **Reddit** threads for user reviews, we use **BERT based semantic search** for text representation and **Aspect Term Based Sentiment Analysis** to generate meaningful recommendations.

## Features

- **Web Scraper**: Automated data scraping with **Selenium** for Reddit posts and comments.  
- **Machine Learning**:  
  - **BERT Embeddings** for document representation.  
  - **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis** for extracting sentiments on specific laptop attributes (battery life, performance, etc.).  
- **Recommendation Engine**: Utilizes aggregated sentiment scores and user preferences to suggest the best laptops.  
- **Full Stack Implementation**:  
  - **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for a responsive UI.  
  - **Backend**: [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for serving ML models and APIs.  
  - **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for scalable data storage.  


## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**:  
   - The system uses Selenium to crawl relevant laptop brands and models.  
   - The collected data is then stored in a PostgreSQL database.

2. **Text Processing & Modeling**:  
   - Text data is cleaned and preprocessed for NLP tasks.  
   - **BERT** embeddings provide robust vector representations.  
   - **Aspect Term Based Sentiment Analysis** identifies user sentiment on specific laptop attributes (e.g., battery life, performance, price).

3. **Recommendation Generation**:  
   - User inputs or preferences are matched against sentiment scores and embeddings to suggest the most suitable laptops.  
   - The recommendation engine is served through a Flask API.

4. **Frontend Display**:  
   - A Next.js application fetches recommendations from the Flask API and displays them in a user-friendly interface.
